Space Cows Introduction
A colony of Aucks (super-intelligent alien bioengineers) has landed on Earth and has created new species of farm animals! The Aucks are performing their experiments on Earth, and plan on transporting the mutant animals back to their home planet of Aurock. In this problem set, you will implement algorithms to figure out how the aliens should shuttle their experimental animals back across space.

Getting started!

Download pset1.zip from the website.

Please do not rename the files we provide you with, change any of the provided helper functions, change function/method names, or delete provided docstrings. You will need to keep ps1_partition.py and ps1_cow_data.txt in the same folder as ps1.py.


Transporting Cows Across Space!

The aliens have succeeded in breeding cows that jump over the moon! Now they want to take home their mutant cows. The aliens want to take all chosen cows back, but their spaceship has a weight limit and they want to minimize the number of trips they have to take across the universe. Somehow, the aliens have developed breeding technology to make cows with only integer weights.

The data for the cows to be transported is stored in ps1_cow_data.txt. All of your code for Part A should go into ps1.py.

First we need to load the cow data from the data file ps1_cow_data.txt, this has already been done for you and should let you begin working on the rest of this problem. If you are having issues getting the ps1_cow_data.txt to load, be sure that you have it in the same folder as the ps1.py that you are running.

You can expect the data to be formatted in pairs of x,y on each line, where x is the name of the cow and y is a number indicating how much the cow weighs in tons, and that all of the cows have unique names. Here are the first few lines of ps1_cow_data.txt:

# One way of transporting cows is to always pick the heaviest cow that will fit onto the spaceship first. This is an example of a greedy
# algorithm. So if there are only 2 tons of free space on your spaceship, with one cow that's 3 tons and another that's 1 ton, the 1 ton
# cow will get put onto the spaceship.

# Implement a greedy algorithm for transporting the cows back across space in the function greedy_cow_transport. The function returns a
# list of lists, where each inner list represents a trip and contains the names of cows taken on that trip.

# Note: Make sure not to mutate the dictionary of cows that is passed in!

# Assumptions:
# The order of the list of trips does not matter. That is, [[1,2],[3,4]] and [[3,4],[1,2]] are considered equivalent lists of trips.
# All the cows are between 0 and 100 tons in weight.
# All the cows have unique names.
# If multiple cows weigh the same amount, break ties arbitrarily.

# The spaceship has a cargo weight limit (in tons), which is passed into the function as a parameter.

# Example:
# Suppose the spaceship has a weight limit of 10 tons and the set of cows to transport is
# {"Jesse": 6, "Maybel": 3, "Callie": 2, "Maggie": 5}.
# The greedy algorithm will first pick Jesse as the heaviest cow for the first trip. There is still space for 4 tons on the trip. Since
# Maggie will not fit on this trip, the greedy algorithm picks Maybel, the heaviest cow that will still fit. Now there is only 1 ton of
# space left, and none of the cows can fit in that space, so the first trip is [Jesse, Maybel].
# For the second trip, the greedy algorithm first picks Maggie as the heaviest remaining cow, and then picks Callie as the last cow.
# Since they will both fit, this makes the second trip [[Maggie], [Callie]].
# The final result then is [["Jesse", "Maybel"], ["Maggie", "Callie"]].


# Enter your code for the Greedy Cow Transport here

    """
    Uses a greedy heuristic to determine an allocation of cows that attempts to
    minimize the number of spaceship trips needed to transport all the cows. The
    returned allocation of cows may or may not be optimal.
    The greedy heuristic should follow the following method:
    1. As long as the current trip can fit another cow, add the largest cow that will fit
        to the trip
    2. Once the trip is full, begin a new trip to transport the remaining cows
    Does not mutate the given dictionary of cows.
    Parameters:
    cows - a dictionary of name (string), weight (int) pairs
    limit - weight limit of the spaceship (an int)
    
    Returns:
    A list of lists, with each inner list containing the names of cows
    transported on a particular trip and the overall list containing all the
    trips
