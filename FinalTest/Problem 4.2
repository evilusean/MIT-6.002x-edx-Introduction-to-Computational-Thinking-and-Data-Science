# Problem 4-2
# 20.0/20.0 points (graded)
# Write a function called getAverage(die, numRolls, numTrials), with the following specification:
def getAverage(die, numRolls, numTrials):
    """
      - die, a Die
      - numRolls, numTrials, are positive ints
      - Calculates the expected mean value of the longest run of a number
        over numTrials runs of numRolls rolls.
      - Calls makeHistogram to produce a histogram of the longest runs for all
        the trials. There should be 10 bins in the histogram
      - Choose appropriate labels for the x and y axes.
      - Returns the mean calculated to 3 decimal places
    """

# A run of numbers counts the number of times the same dice value shows up in consecutive rolls. For example:
# a dice roll of 1 4 3 has a longest run of 1
# a dice roll of 1 3 3 2 has a longest run of 2
# a dice roll of 5 4 4 4 5 5 2 5 has a longest run of 3

# When this function is called with the test case given in the file, it will return 5.312. Your simulation may give slightly different
# values.

# Paste your entire function (including the definition) in the box.

# Restrictions:
# Do not import or use functions or methods from pylab, numpy, or matplotlib.
# Do not leave any debugging print statements when you paste your code in the box.
# If you do not see the return value being printed when testing your function, close the histogram window.


# Paste your code here
