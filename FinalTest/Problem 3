# Problem 3-1
# 4.0/4.0 points (graded)
# You have a bucket with 4 red balls and 4 green balls. You draw 3 balls out of the bucket. Assume that once you draw a ball out of the
# bucket, you don't replace it. What is the probability of drawing 3 balls of the same color? Answer the question in reduced fraction
# form - eg 1/5 instead of 2/10.

# 1/7
# correct


# Problem 3-2
# 16.0/16.0 points (graded)
# Write a Monte Carlo simulation to solve the above problem. Feel free to write a helper function if you wish.

# Paste your entire function (including the definition) in the box.

# Restrictions:
# Do not import or use functions or methods from pylab, numpy, or matplotlib.
# Do not leave any debugging print statements when you paste your code in the box.

    4 red and 4 green balls. Balls are not replaced once
    drawn. Returns a float - the fraction of times 3
